StallSpot FloorPlan System - Two Page Architecture

1. FLOORPLAN EDITOR PAGE (Creator Studio) 
   I want to make this as good as Coral or autocad where professional floor plans are created also you can consider SmartDraw as example too but its UI and every thing is boring we don't need that we will be using konva for this as its a good graphical library in Canvas libraries 
   A. Core Canvas Features
      - Infinite canvas with zoom/pan
      - grid and rulers
      - Smart guides and snap points
      - History management (undo/redo)
      - Keyboard shortcuts

   B. Shape Tools
      - Basic Shapes: Rectangle, Circle, Arrow
      - Advanced Shapes: Polygon, Line, Curve
      - Stall Shapes: this shapes will be used for the floorplan and create them in konva as custom shape and
        their Measurement should be shown around it , Measurement can be customized 
            1. **Standard Booth** (10x10 ft)

   For this we will do 2 parts in 1st part the floorplan will be shown and in 2nd part only  buttons or divs showing their number when clicked on it 
   stall details will be shown and also these can be filtered according to below filters so the user will click on this and see in the floorplan to locate where its stall is located in the part 1 by this we can make things easy for backend and also we cannot convert existing floorplan of user it can be in any file format jpeg,png,dwg,dxf we will just provide an option to add the 2nd part buttons or divs so that we don't have to bear the interactivity for the floorplan
